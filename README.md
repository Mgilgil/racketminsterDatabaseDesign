# racketminsterDatabaseDesign


This project was created as part of my university coursework.  
It demonstrates the design and implementation of a database system for **Racketminster**, a sports organisation that manages parks, courts, equipment, sessions, bookings, and players.

## Features  

- **Part A: Conceptual EERD Design**  
  - Includes key entities such as Staff, Parks, Courts, Equipment, Players, Sessions, and Bookings.  
  - Use of **specialisations** (e.g., Caretaker, Instructor, One-to-one/Group sessions, Fitness/Coaching/Social subtypes).  
  - Full **multiplicity justifications** to reflect real-world constraints.  

- **Part B: Logical ERD Implementation**  
  - Translation of the conceptual model into a logical relational schema.  
  - Entities mapped to relational tables with attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys.  
  - Enforces **normalisation principles** to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.  
  - Supports queries and constraints consistent with the business rules of Racketminster.

## Database Techniques Used  

This coursework demonstrates a variety of **database system design concepts**, including:  

- **Entity-Relationship (ER/EER) Modelling**  
- **Logical ERD Development**  
- **Multiplicity & Participation Constraints**  
- **Normalisation & Redundancy Reduction**  
- **Database Integrity & Constraints**
